#  Chapter 1: Hello Theos

Hi, Hello! Welcome to the first tutorial of our **AkariiCasts**! My name is Leptos and I think it’s wonderful that you’re joining us on this *creative* adventure.

Before we dive into Theos I’d like to point one thing out. If at any time during the course you want follow along in the code, you can download the project and script from the description.

Now, I want you to immediately take one thing with you. What you can do with what you’ll learn is only limited by your *imagination* (or sometimes the lack of coding skills… *ahem*… or is that just me?).

So, what is *Theos*? Theos is a build system that makes it easy to, you guessed it, build tweaks! Which is of course very handy for us to quickly get started on a new amazing idea. For example, Theos provides us with many *templates* to choose from and you can even create your own templates. Aside from that it’s very easy to extend Theos with *libraries* for us to use in our projects.

Got that? Great. I can hear you saying already “Theory is cool and all, but I wanna start coding finally!”

Let’s do that.
